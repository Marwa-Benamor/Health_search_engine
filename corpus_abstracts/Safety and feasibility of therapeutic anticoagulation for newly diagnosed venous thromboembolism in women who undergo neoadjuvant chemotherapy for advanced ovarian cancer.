Objective: We sought to investigate the safety and feasibility of therapeutic anticoagulation for newly diagnosed venous thromboembolism among women who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. Methods: A retrospective study using data extrapolated from a prospectively maintained institutional database was used to identify all patients with ovarian cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy from April 2015 through September 2018 at our institution. All patients who received therapeutic anticoagulation for newly diagnosed venous thromboembolism at initial diagnosis or during neoadjuvant chemotherapy were included. Results: Of 290 patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer during the study period, 67 (23%) had newly diagnosed venous thromboembolism at the time of initial diagnosis or developed venous thromboembolism during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Of these 67 patients, 64 (96%) received therapeutic anticoagulation. A total of 13 (20%) of 64 patients who underwent therapeutic anticoagulation experienced a bleeding episode while on anticoagulation; 4 (31%) of the 13 events were of major severity. Three patients developed major internal bleeding in the peritoneal cavity, and one patient suffered from a major vaginal bleeding episode. All four patients were hospitalized (range, 5-11 days) and received â‰¥2 units of red blood cells for anemia. None of these patients died from fatal bleeding or had to delay starting chemotherapy. Of note, all four patients received low-molecular-weight heparin via subcutaneous injection. Overall, 13 (20%) of 64 patients required an anticoagulant dose reduction, mostly due to weight loss or new bleeding episodes. Conclusion: Therapeutic anticoagulation in this setting appeared safe, with a low risk of major bleeding complications. Furthermore, anticoagulation did not result in delay of chemotherapy or cytoreductive surgery.
