Objective: To investigate the detection rate and hematologic phenotype of HKαα thalassemia in south Guangxi, in order to provide reference for the prevention and control of thalassemia and prenatal and postnatal care consultation in this region. Methods: Gene testing was performed on pre-marital medical examinations, pre-pregnancy eugenic health examinations, prenatal examinations and hospitalized thalassemia-positive persons in south of Guangxi, and the results were analyzed. Results: A total of 183 190 thalassemia patients were included in this study, the age was mainly concentrated in 26-35 years old (101 709 cases, accounting for 55.521%), and 40 HKαα mutations were detected, detection rate was 0.022%, including 5 cases in Nanning, 22 cases in Qinzhou, 2 cases in Fangchenggang, 11 cases in Beihai. A total of 29 ethnic groups were included in the survey, but HKαα gene was observed only in Han nationality (0.0380%) and Zhuang nationality (0.0068%). A total of 8 genotypes carrying HKαα mutations were detected in this study ( HKαα/--SEA, βN/ βN, HKαα/αα, β-28/ βN, HKαα/αα, β-50/ βN, HKαα/αα, βCD17/ βN, HKαα/αα, βCD27/28/β N, HKαα/αα, βCD41-42/ βN, HKαα/αα, βCD71-72/ βN, and HKαα/αα, βN/ βN). Except for most cases with HKαα/αα, βN/ βN genotypes with no significant changes in the hematological indexes, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) of other genotypes were decreased, showing microcytic hypochromic performance, mild anemia or no anemia. Conclusion: HKαα carrier is often misdiagnosed as -α3.7 carrier, which easily leads to missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously improve the diagnostic level of laboratory testing personnels and genetic counselors to avoid unnecessary interventional puncture operations and birth of children with moderate and severe thalassemia.
