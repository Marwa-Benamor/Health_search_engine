Salmonella species is a rare cause of infective endocarditis that commonly involves a prosthetic or a previously damaged heart valve. We present a case of a 25-year-old young man with a one and a half month history of cough, fever, shortness of breath, and hemoptysis. Clinical examination revealed bilateral mid-zone crackles, palpable tip of the spleen, and an early diastolic murmur in the aortic (A2) area. Initial laboratory results indicated anemia with leukocytosis, raised inflammatory markers, and low serum albumin. Blood cultures showed the growth of multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhi. A radiological workup showed multiple aortic valve vegetation. Salmonella endocarditis was diagnosed based on Duke's criteria. The patient was treated with culture-sensitive antibiotics and subsequently showed significant clinical recovery. This case highlights a rare multidrug-resistant Salmonella endocarditis of a native valve. It also emphasizes the difficulties in making a diagnosis and the benefit of using a multidisciplinary strategy to manage challenging clinical manifestations.
