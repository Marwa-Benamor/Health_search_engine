Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common nutrient-related health problem in the world. There is still a lack of comprehensive comparative study on the efficacies of commonly used iron supplements such as polysaccharide iron complex (PIC), iron protein succinylate (IPS) and ferrous succinate (FS) for IDA. In this study, we compared the PIC, IPS and FS efficacies in IDA rats via intragastric administration. The results showed that the three iron supplements had similar efficacies. PIC/IPS/FS at a dose of 15 mg Fe/kg/d for 10 d increased the hematological and serum biochemical parameters to 2.15/2.12/2.18 (Hb), 1.71/1.67/1.69 (RBC), 2.10/2.11/2.12 (HCT), 1.26/1.22/1.22 (MCV), all 1.34 (MCH), 1.15/1.15/1.14 (MCHC), 1.94/1.82/1.91 (SF), 9.75/9.67/9.53 (SI), and 23.30/22.68/21.64 (TS) times, and reduced TIBC to 0.42/0.43/0.44 times, compared to untreated IDA rats. PIC performed slightly better than IPS and FS in restoring MCV level. Meanwhile, the heart, spleen and kidney coefficients reduced to 67%/74%/65% (heart), all 59% (spleen) and 87%/88%/88% (kidney), and the liver coefficient increased to 116%/115%/116%, compared to untreated IDA rats. The liver iron content was found to be more affected by IDA than the spleen iron content. PIC/IPS/FS at 15 mg Fe/kg/d increased organ iron contents to 4.20/3.97/4.03 times (liver) and 1.36/1.24/1.41 times (spleen) within 10 d compared to untreated IDA rats, and PIC-H and FS were slightly better than IPS in restoring spleen iron content. The results of this study can provide useful data information for the comparison of three iron supplements, PIC, IPS and FS.
