Background: Sepsis patients have a high mortality rate and are frequently anemic. The importance of early detection and blood transfusion treatment cannot be overstated. Objective: A systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature was conducted to evaluate the association between hemoglobin and the prognosis of patients with sepsis. Methods: The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Chinese Biomedical Literature (CBM) databases were searched from inception to May 21, 2023. Pediatric patients were excluded, and there were no language restrictions. A random effects model was used to calculate pooled odds ratios to assess the relationship between hemoglobin and prognosis in sepsis. Results: There were 110,004 patients included in 9 studies, of which 51,568 had a poor prognosis. The results of univariate and multivariate analyzes showed that hemoglobin was associated with the prognosis of patients with sepsis (univariate OR: 1.35, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.16-1.58; multivariate OR: 1.26, 95 % CI: 1.13-1.40). Dose-response meta-analysis showed that there was a nonlinear relationship between hemoglobin level and prognosis in patients with sepsis. Conclusion: The level of hemoglobin at admission is related to the prognosis of patients with sepsis, and decreases in hemoglobin level are associated with an increase in the mortality rate of patients with sepsis. Therefore, early transfusion of red blood cells should be performed in patients with sepsis, and early attention should be given to anemia in patients with sepsis. However, more robust studies are needed to further determine the level of early hemoglobin maintenance in patients with sepsis.
