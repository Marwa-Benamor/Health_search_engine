This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of camrelizumab combined with chemotherapy during preoperative neoadjuvant therapy in patients with locally advanced resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) of clinical Stages II and III. The patients received camrelizumab plus chemotherapy regimen on Day 1 for up to three to four cycles (3 weeks per cycle). The probabilities of overall survival (OS) were 55.6% at 12 months and 35.6% at 18 months (45 patients). The disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 70.0% at 12 months and 63.3% at 18 months (30 patients). The median OS and DFS were not reached. The proportion of patients at postneoadjuvant pathological tumor stages ypT0, ypT2, and ypT3 were 10 (33.3%), 14 (46.7%), and 6 (20.0%), respectively, and those at stages ypN0 and ypN1 were 19 (63.3%) and 11 (36.7%), respectively. Additionally, the pathological complete response rate was 33.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.154-0.512), and the major pathologic response rate was 46.7% (95% CI: 0.277-0.656). Grade â‰¥3 adverse events (AEs) were reported in five patients (11.1%), with vomiting being the most common AE (three patients; 3.3%). Other common AEs of any grade included decreased lymphocyte count (48.9%), reactive capillary endothelial proliferation (46.7%), decreased white blood cell count (40.0%), anemia (31.1%), and vomiting (31.1%). The combination of camrelizumab and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced resectable ESCC demonstrated promising efficacy and acceptable safety.
