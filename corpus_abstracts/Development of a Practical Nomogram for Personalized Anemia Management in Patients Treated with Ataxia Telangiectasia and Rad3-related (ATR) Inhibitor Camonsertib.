Purpose: Camonsertib is a highly selective and potent inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase. Dose-dependent anemia is a class-related on-target adverse event often requiring dose modifications. Individual patient risk factors for the development of significant anemia complicate the selection of a "one-size-fits-all" ATR inhibitor (ATRi) dose and schedule, possibly leading to suboptimal therapeutic doses in patients at low risk of anemia. We evaluated whether early predictors of anemia could be identified to ultimately inform a personalized dose-modification approach. Methods: Based on preclinical observations and a mechanistic understanding of ATRi-related anemia, we identified several potential factors to explore in a multivariable linear regression modelling tool for predicting hemoglobin level ahead of day 22 (cycle 2) of treatment. Results: In patients treated with camonsertib monotherapy (NCT04497116), we observed that hemoglobin decline is consistently preceded by reticulocytopenia, and dose- and exposure-dependent decreases in monocytes. We developed a nomogram incorporating baseline and day 8 hemoglobin and reticulocyte values that predicted the day 22 hemoglobin values of patients with clinically valuable concordance (within 7.5% of observations) 80% of the time in a cross-validation performance test of data from 60 patients. Conclusion: The prediction of future hemoglobin decrease, after a week of treatment, may enable a personalized, early dose modification to prevent development of clinically significant anemia and resulting unscheduled dose holds or transfusions.
