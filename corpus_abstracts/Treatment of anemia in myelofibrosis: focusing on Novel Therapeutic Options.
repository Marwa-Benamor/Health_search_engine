Introduction: Myelofibrosis is a clonal myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, increased bone marrow fibrosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, hepatosplenomegaly, abnormal cytokine production, and constitutional symptoms. These and many other factors contribute to the development of anemia in myelofibrosis patients. Areas covered: This review summarizes novel and promising treatments for anemia in myelofibrosis including transforming growth factor-Î² inhibitors luspatercept and KER-050, JAK inhibitors momelotinib, pacritinib, and jaktinib, BET inhibitors pelabresib and ABBV-744, antifibrotic PRM-151, BCL2/BCL-XL inhibitor navitoclax, and telomerase inhibitor imetelstat. Expert opinion: Standard approaches to treat myelofibrosis-related anemia have limited efficacy and are associated with toxicity. New drugs have shown positive results in myelofibrosis-associated anemia when used alone or in combination.
