Patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) frequently employ inferior vena cava (IVC) filters to keep them from getting pulmonary embolisms. Even though they are usually thought to be safe, there can be complications during or after their placement. IVC filter perforation into adjacent structures, such as the duodenum, is an uncommon but potentially serious complication. We present a case of a 62-year-old female with a past medical history of recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) and pulmonary embolism who presented with dizziness and dyspnea due to gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, resulting in anemia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was done and revealed a metallic object extending into the duodenum, identified as the IVC filter.
