Background: Overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (OHSt) is a rare disorder characterized by abnormalities in erythrocytic volume homeostasis. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential for appropriate management and genetic counseling. Methods: We present the case of a child with beta-thalassemia and a history of multiple blood transfusions. Clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and genetic testing were reviewed. Peripheral blood smear examination and genetic analysis were performed. Results: The patient was admitted with severe anemia, and peripheral blood smear examination revealed the presence of up to 50% stomatocytes. Laboratory investigations showed abnormalities in red blood cell parameters, including decreased hemoglobin levels and increased mean corpuscular volume. Genetic testing identified a heterozygous mutation in the RHAG gene, confirming the diagnosis of OHSt. The presence of stomatocytes in the peripheral blood smear was transient, correlating with episodes of hemolysis and its control.
