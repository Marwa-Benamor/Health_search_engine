Introduction: Anaemia in pregnant women is a major public health problem and is associated with adverse outcomes both in pregnant mothers and new-borns. According to NFHS-5, 45.7% of women in urban India were affected by anaemia during their pregnancy. The objectives of this study were to estimate the proportion of pregnant women who were anaemic and its effect on maternal and birth outcomes, and additionally, to assess the various socio-economic factors contributing to anaemia during pregnancy. Methodology: Data was collected by reviewing records between December 2018 and December 2021 of 302 pregnant women who had received antenatal care at a secondary level health facility in Krishnagiri, Tamil Nadu. The data included details of socio-economic parameters, parity, haemoglobin levels, mode of delivery, pregnancy related complications during the antenatal period and during delivery, including need for blood transfusions in mothers. Birth-related outcomes like miscarriages, intra-uterine death, low birth weight (LBW), need for NICU admission and congenital defects were also analysed. Variables in the study are described as frequencies and proportions. Appropriate tests were used to check for association and a P- value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: The mean age of the women was 24 ± 3.72 years and the mean Haemoglobin level during the first trimester was 10.5 ± 1.12 gm/dl. The proportion of women with anaemia in the first trimester was 174 (57.6%). Among the anaemics, 15 (8.6%) required treatment in the form of injectable iron and 29 (16.7%) required blood transfusion. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (31.6%) (P < 0.05), preeclampsia (38.9%) (P < 0.02) less among anaemic. Hyperemesis (66.7%) (P = 0.58), risk of miscarriage (57.8%) (P = 0.94), postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) (80.0%) (P = 0.15) was higher in the anaemic group. Adverse Neonatal-related outcomes such as low birth weight babies (52.0%) (P = 0.54), meconium aspiration (72.7%) (P = 0.25) and need for NICU admission (75.0%) (P = 0.25) was higher in babies born to anaemic pregnant women. Conclusions: The proportion of anaemic women was 57.6%. There was no significant difference in maternal demographic characteristics or obstetric factors between anaemic and non-anaemic pregnant women. GDM, pre-eclampsia was less prevalent among anaemic women. Hyperemesis, risk of abortion, postpartum haemorrhage and low birth weight (LBW) infants was higher in anaemic pregnancies. The need for providing education regarding iron supplementation and early detection of anaemia during pregnancy should be emphasised to avoid complications.
