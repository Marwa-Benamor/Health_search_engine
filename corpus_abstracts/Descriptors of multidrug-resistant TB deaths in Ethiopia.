Deaths related to multidrug-resistant TB among patients who had received a second-line anti-TB drugs in Ethiopia were analysed. Respectively 38/704 (5.4%) and 44/995 (4.4%) deaths were identified in two cohorts (2015 and 2022). In the 2015 cohort, severe malnutrition was less prevalent, previous treatment rates were three times higher, hypokalaemia was more frequent, and the use of the XpertÂ® MTB/RIF assay, respiratory failure and severe anaemia/pancytopenia were less common than in the 2022 cohort. We observed that there were variations in adverse events when different treatment regimens were used over different time periods. To ensure proper patient care, correct guidance must be consistently implemented.
