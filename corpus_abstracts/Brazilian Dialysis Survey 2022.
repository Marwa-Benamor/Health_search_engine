Introduction: The Brazilian Dialysis Survey (BDS) is an annual national survey about patients on chronic dialysis that contributes to health policies. Objective: To report the 2022 epidemiological data from the BDS of the Brazilian Society of Nephrology (BSN). Methods: A survey was carried out in Brazilian chronic dialysis centers using an online questionnaire that included clinical and epidemiological aspects of patients on chronic dialysis, dialysis therapy data, and dialysis center characteristics. Results: Overall, 28% (n = 243) of the centers answered the questionnaire. In July 2022, the estimated total number of patients on dialysis was 153,831. The estimated prevalence and incidence rates of patients per million population (pmp) were 758 and 214, respectively. Of the prevalent patients, 95.3% were on hemodialysis (HD, 4.6% of these on hemodiafiltration) and 4.7% on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Only 1.3% of patients were not vaccinated against COVID-19. The prevalence of anemia (Hb < 10g/dL) was 27% and hyperphosphatemia (P > 5.5mg/dL) reached 30%. The estimated overall crude annual mortality rate was 17.1%. Conclusions: The absolute number and prevalence rate of patients on chronic dialysis continue to increase. A growing number of patients were receiving hemodiafiltration. The mortality rate decreased, probably due to the end of COVID-19 pandemic. The conclusions were drawn in the context of relatively low voluntary participation, which imposed methodological limitations on our estimates.
