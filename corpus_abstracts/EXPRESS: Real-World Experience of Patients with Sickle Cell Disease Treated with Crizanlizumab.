In 2019, crizanlizumab was approved by the FDA to reduce the rate of vaso-occlusive crisis in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). We aimed to study the real-world effectiveness of crizanlizumab in our comprehensive sickle cell center. This was a retrospective cohort analysis of patients with SCD who received at least 2 consecutive doses of crizanlizumab. Clinically significant improvement was captured using the Patient Global Impression of Change Scale (PGI-C). As of December 2022, there were 18 patients eligible for analysis with a median age of 30.5 years. Eight patients had the HbSS genotype, 7 HbSC, and 3 HbSB null genotype. Median duration of exposure to crizanlizumab was 53.6 weeks, and 16 (88.9%) patients received crizanlizumab for ≥26 weeks. Crizanlizumab was very well tolerated with no serious adverse events (grade ≥3) related to treatment. There was no significant difference in laboratory parameters. There was a remarkable improvement in patients' subjective response to crizanlizumab infusion. The median PGI-C score of our patients was 5, signifying moderately better with slight but noticeable changes. The morphine equivalent daily doses (MEDD) were lower after crizanlizumab infusion. MEDD prior to crizanlizumab was 90; after ≥2 consecutive crizanlizumab doses, it was 60. There was also a reduction in the hospital admissions, emergency, and urgent care visit for acute pain crisis in 6 (28%) patients. This study shows that crizanlizumab was associated with improvement in patients' response, both directly and indirectly related to the reduction of opioids used, which is consistent with results from the SUSTAIN trial.
