Liver involvement is commonly seen in various haematological disorders. They present clinically with elevation of liver enzymes and organomegaly, with or without mass lesions. However, liver involvement may be silent in many hematological disorders or there may be specific findings in liver biopsy that can lead to the diagnosis of clinically inapparent hematological disorders. Present review highlights features of hepatic manifestations in various hematological diseases with special emphasis on histopathological findings. Among RBC disorders, secondary hemochromatosis is the commonest among patients with hemolytic anemia; whereas Sickle Cell Hepatopathy is a well known complication in Sickle Cell Disease, characterised by sequestration of sickled RBCs in sinusoids. Vascular complications such as Budd Chiari syndrome and portal venopathy with portal vein thrombosis are seen in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. However, sometimes primary hematological disease may remain occult. Various lymphomas show characteristic pattern of hepatic involvement, most common being sinusoidal and portal infiltration. Pattern of infiltration may give clues to different types of lymphomas. Amongst all lymphomas, Diffuse large B cell lymphoma is the most common lymphoma involving liver. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a fatal systemic condition and liver involvement by widespread fibrin thrombi, is not an exception. Assessing liver histopathology in context of hematological conditions makes better understanding of pathophysiology and progress of these diseases. It is important for hematologists and hepatologist to be aware of possible liver involvement in various hematological diseases presenting with elevated LFTs and have a logical approach to abnormal LFTs.
