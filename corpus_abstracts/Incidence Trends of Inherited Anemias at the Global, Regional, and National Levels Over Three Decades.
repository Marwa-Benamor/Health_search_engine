Inherited anemia continues to pose a significant public health concern on a global scale, owing to its extensive geographical prevalence, substantial patient population, and profound ramifications. Here, we investigated detailed information on inherited anemias (including thalassemias, thalassemias trait, sickle cell disease, sickle cell trait, G6PD deficiency, and G6PD trait) for the period 1990-2019 from the Global Burden of Disease study. Over the course of three decades, there has been a persistent rise in the incidence of inherited anemias worldwide, culminating in a total of 44,896,026 incident cases in 2019. However, the prevalence of inherited anemias has exhibited a consistent downward trend over successive years. Significantly, these inherited anemias primarily impact females, exhibiting a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.88. Among males, the most prevalent inherited anemia is G6PD deficiency, whereas G6PD trait prevails among females. The incidence rates of inherited anemias and their temporal trend exhibited significant variations across different regions, with Central Sub-Saharan Africa displaying the highest incidence rates and Central Latin America experiencing the most substantial decline. The findings of this study suggest a significant correlation between the Socio-Demographic index (SDI) and incidence rates of inherited anemias, particularly in regions with lower SDI levels such as Africa and South Asia. These results contribute valuable insights for the analysis of global trends in the burden of inherited anemias.
