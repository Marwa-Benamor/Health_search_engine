Introduction: Neural tube defects (NTDs) are severe birth defects caused by nutritional, genetic or environmental factors. Because NTDs continue to have a significant health and economic impact on children and community at large, it is crucial to investigate potential risk factors in order to develop novel approaches to NTDs prevention. Determinants for the development of NTDs differ by country, region as well as within the country. The objective of this study was to identify the determinants of NTDs among newborns delivered in three hospitals found in eastern Ethiopia. Methods: A hospital-based matched case-control study was conducted among 138 cases and 138 control women who delivered in three teaching hospitals in Eastern Ethiopia in 2021. Data were collected using a structured and pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire. Cases were mothers who delivered a neonate with any type of NTDs regardless of gestational age or fetal viability, whereas controls were mothers who delivered an apparently healthy newborn. Chi-square was used to assess the significant difference between the two groups. Conditional logistic regression model was used to generate adjusted odds ratio with its corresponding 95% confidence intervals and compare the two groups. Results: Anencephaly (51.4%) and spinal bifida (34.1%) were the most frequently observed NTDs. None of study participants took preconception folic acid supplementation. Being a non-formal mothers (AOR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.12-0.92, P = 0.034), rural residence, (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.18-9.78, P = 0.023), history of spontaneous abortion (AOR = 2.95, 95% CI: 1.15-7.55, P = 0.023), having severe anemia (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.17-9.87, P = 0.024), history of fever or cold (AOR = 2.75; 95% CI: 1.05-7.15, P = 0.038), and an exposure to various agro-chemicals (AOR = 3.39, 95% CI: 1.11-10.3, P = 0.032) were independent determinants of NTDs. Conclusion and recommendation: In this study, NTDs were associated to several determinant factors in the area, including residential area, history of spontaneous abortion, severe anemia, fever/cold, antibiotic use before or during early pregnancy, and exposure to agrochemicals. Addressing the identified determinants is critical in averting the incidence of NTDs in the study area. Moreover, more research is needed to investigate women's dietary practices as well as the practice of preconception folic acid supplementation for pregnant women in Ethiopia's current health care system.
