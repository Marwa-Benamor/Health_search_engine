Measures of muscle and adipose tissue mass have been associated with outcomes in several malignancies, but studies in multiple myeloma (MM) are inconsistent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between muscle and fat areas and radiodensity, and overall survival (OS) in patients with newly diagnosed MM. We included 341 patients diagnosed with MM from 2010-2019 who had an 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography at diagnosis. A cross-sectional image at the third lumbar vertebrae was segmented into muscle and fat components. Median follow up was 5.7 years. There was no association between sarcopenia and baseline disease characteristics or OS. Low muscle radiodensity was associated with higher disease stage, anemia, and renal failure. OS was 5.6 vs. 9.0 years in patients with muscle radiodensity in the lower vs. middle/upper tertiles, respectively (P = 0.02). High subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) radiodensity was associated with higher stage, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercalcemia, renal failure, and high LDH. OS was 5.4 years vs. not reached in patients with SAT radiodensity in the upper vs. middle/lower tertiles, respectively (P = 0.001). In conclusion, sarcopenia was not associated with OS in MM patients. High SAT radiodensity and low muscle radiodensity were associated with advanced disease stage and adverse laboratory characteristics.
