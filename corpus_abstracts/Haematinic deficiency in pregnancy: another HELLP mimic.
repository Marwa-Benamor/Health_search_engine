Haematinic deficiency is not uncommon in pregnancy. Folate deficiency is more common than B12 deficiency because of the increased uptake of folate in pregnancy, and the fact that B12 stores take much longer to deplete. Described here are five cases of anaemia in pregnancy secondary to severe haematinic deficiency with subsequent management and pregnancy outcomes. In the majority of cases, the women were proteinuric, but systemically well and normotensive. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and HELLP were both considered, but the identification of very abnormal folate levels of less than 3 Î¼g/L in all and low B12 deficiency in the majority made haematinic deficiency the most likely diagnosis. They all received high dose folic acid, parenteral vitamin B12 and oral iron and made good haematological recoveries. Adequate antenatal correction of vitamin deficiency like this avoids bone marrow suppression and helps minimise poor obstetric outcomes associated with pre-existing anaemia including post-partum haemorrhage.
