Delusional parasitosis (DP) is a psychiatric condition characterized by the false belief of skin infestation. However, the coexistence of medical conditions, such as iron deficiency anemia, may complicate the clinical presentation and treatment approach. The present case provides an overview of the challenges faced with the diagnosis and management of DP in a patient with a co-morbid medical condition. It highlights the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in achieving a favorable outcome. Through this case, we shed light on the possible multifactorial origins of DP and emphasize the importance of a comprehensive approach to care for patients with this condition. It also underscores the need for timely recognition and appropriate treatment to improve the quality of life for individuals affected by this debilitating psychiatric condition.
