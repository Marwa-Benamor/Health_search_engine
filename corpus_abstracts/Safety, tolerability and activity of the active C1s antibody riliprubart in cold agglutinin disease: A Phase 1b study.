Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare autoimmune hemolytic anemia characterized by complement pathway-mediated hemolysis. Riliprubart (SAR445088, BIVV020), a second-generation classical complement inhibitor, is a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits only the activated form of C1s. This Phase 1b study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and effect on hemolysis of riliprubart in adult patients with CAD. On Day 1, 12 patients received a single IV dose of either 30 mg/kg (n=6) or 15 mg/kg (n=6) of riliprubart and were subsequently followed for 15 weeks. Riliprubart was generally well tolerated; there were no treatment-emergent serious adverse events, or treatment-emergent adverse events leading to death or permanent study discontinuation. There were no reports of serious infections, encapsulated bacterial infections including meningococcal infections, hypersensitivity, or thromboembolic events. Rapid improvements in hemoglobin (Day 5) and bilirubin (Day 1) were observed in both treatment cohorts. Mean hemoglobin levels were maintained at >11.0 g/dL from Day 29 and mean levels of bilirubin were normalized by Day 29; both responses were maintained throughout the study. Improvements in clinical markers closely correlated with a sustained reduction in the 50% hemolytic complement (CH50) throughout the study. Mean C4 levels, an in vivo marker of treatment activity, increased 1 week after treatment with either dose of riliprubart and were sustained throughout the study. In conclusion, a single IV dose of riliprubart was well tolerated, and led to rapid classical complement inhibition, control of hemolysis, and improvement in anemia, all of which were sustained over 15 weeks.
