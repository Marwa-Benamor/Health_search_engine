Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare disorder caused by complement-mediated hemolysis and thrombosis through the alternative pathway. The most common symptom of PNH is fatigue due to chronic anemia, which can negatively impact quality of life (QoL) and affect overall well-being. The currently approved therapies for PNH significantly limit intravascular hemolysis (IVH) and reduce the risk of thrombosis; however, they are associated with an infusion schedule that can become burdensome, and not all patients experience complete disease control. Several new complement inhibitors are in development that address the need for convenient routes of administration and aim to provide better disease control. With the variety of new treatment options on the horizon, hematologic markers as well as QoL concerns, patient opinion, and lifestyle factors should be considered to choose the optimal PNH treatment for each specific patient.
