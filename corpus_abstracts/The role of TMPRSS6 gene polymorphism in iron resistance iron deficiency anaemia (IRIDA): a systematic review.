Iron resistance iron deficiency anaemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hypochromic microcytic anaemia, low transferrin saturation and inappropriately high hepcidin levels. The aetiology of this condition is rooted in genetic variations within the transmembrane serine protease 6 (TMPRSS6) genes, responsible for encoding matriptase-2, a pivotal negative regulator of hepcidin. We conducted a systematic search across four electronic databases, yielding 538 articles in total out of which 25 were finally included and were preceded further, aiming to prognosticate prevalent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and detrimental genetic alterations. This review aims to elucidate the effects of various SNPs and pathogenic mutations on both haematological and biochemical parameters, as well as their potential interethnic correlation. Employing bioinformatics tools, we subjected over 100 SNPs to scrutiny, discerning their potential functional ramifications. We found rs1373272804, rs1430692214 and rs855791 variants to be most frequent and were having a significant impact on haematological and biochemical profile. We found that individuals of European ancestry were more prone to have these variants compared to other ethnic groups. In conclusion, this review not only sheds light on the association of TMPRSS6 polymorphism in iron resistance iron deficiency anaemia (IRIDA), but also highlights the critical need for further investigations involving larger sample size and more diverse ethnic groups around the globe. These future studies will be vital for gaining a stronger and more reliable understanding of how these genetic differences are linked to the development of IRIDA.
