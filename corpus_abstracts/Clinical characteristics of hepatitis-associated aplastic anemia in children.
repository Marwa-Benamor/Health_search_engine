To understand the current situation of hepatitis-related aplastic anemia (HAAA) in children, we analyzed the patients with HAAA admitted to our hospital in the past 5 years to understand the disease characteristics and prognosis. The clinical data of patients with HAAA admitted to our hospital from February 2017 to May 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 81 patients with HAAA, 56 males and 25 females. The median onset age was 5.9 years. The median time from hepatitis to occurrence of hemocytopenia was 30 days, and the median follow-up time was 2.77 years. There were 23 cases (28.5%) of severe aplastic anemia (SAA), 50 cases of very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA), and 8 cases of non-severe aplastic anemia (NSAA). At the beginning of the disease, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) was higher than normal in 60% of patients, and the median CD4/CD8 ratio was 0.2. As of follow-up, 72 children survived, 4 were lost, and 5 died. Thirty-four cases were treated with immunosuppressive therapy (IST), with a median follow-up time of 0.97 years. The total reaction rate was 73.5% (25/34), the complete reaction rate was 67.6% (23/34), and the nonreaction rate was 26.5% (9/34). Multivariate analysis suggested that co-infection was an independent risk factor affecting the efficacy of IST at 6 months, with an OR value of 16.76, 95% CI (1.23, 227.95), P=0.034. No independent influencing factors were found at the end of follow-up. The proportion of CTL cells in peripheral blood of children with HAAA is relatively increased, and IST is effective in 73.5% of children. Co-infection may prolongs the time to response to IST.
