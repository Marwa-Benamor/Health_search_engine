Background: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare and fatal thrombotic microangiopathy-based hematologic disease. Stroke has been reported as atypical neurological manifestations of TTP in some cases. Case presentation: A 65-year-old male presented with typical acute ischemic stroke symptoms including sudden-onset dysarthria, right-sided facial paralysis and hemiplegia. However, his CT and MRI scans were negative without showing any new ischemic lesions. He was diagnosed with TTP with severe thrombocytopenia, mild anemia, increased LDH, and low ADAMTS-13 activity. The symptoms and positive signs were rapidly resolved after administrating the plasma exchange therapy. Conclusion: Clinicians should consider the possibility of TTP when a patient presents with acute stroke-like symptoms and thrombocytopenia, especially in an emergency room, either with or without new stroke lesions on the brain CT and MRI.
