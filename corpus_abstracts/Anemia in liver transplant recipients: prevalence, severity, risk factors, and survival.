Information about anemia in liver transplant (LTx) recipients is scarce. We investigated the prevalence and severity of anemia before and within the first-year post-LTx, risk factors for having anemia before LTx, and 1-year survival according to anemia status before LTx. This retrospective cohort study received data from The Knowledge Center for Transplantation database at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression were used to investigate factors associated with anemia and a Kaplan-Meier plot to illustrate the probability of survival. We included 346 first-time adult LTx recipients. The median age was 50 years (IQR: 42-57), and 203 (59%) were male. The prevalence of anemia before and 1-year post-LTx were 69 and 45%, respectively. Male sex (aOR 4.0 [95% CI: 2.2-7.2]; p < 0.001) and each unit increase in MELD score (aOR 1.2 [95% CI: 1.1-1.2]; p < 0.001) were positively associated with anemia before LTx. Compared to autoimmune liver diseases, LTx recipients with fulminant hepatic failure (aOR 0.03 [0.00-0.17]; p = 0.001) had lower odds for anemia. The 1-year survival in LTx recipients who had and did not have anemia before transplantation were 93 and 91% (p = 0.47). Anemia was frequent among LTx recipients, and anemia before LTx did not affect 1-year survival.
