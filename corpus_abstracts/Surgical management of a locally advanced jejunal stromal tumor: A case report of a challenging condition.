Introduction and importance: Locally advanced jejunal stromal tumors stand as a captivating and relatively rare entity, garnering attention for several reasons. Their inaccessible location by conventional endoscopy poses a diagnostic challenge. Further, treatment decisions necessitate a multidisciplinary approach, compounded by the absence of high-level evidence studies. Case presentation: A 54-year-old patient was admitted to our surgical department with abdominal pain and chronic anemia. Abdominal CT imaging confirmed the presence of a non-metastatic sizable jejunal tumor. The patient underwent laparotomy, revealing a locally advanced jejunal tumor contracting the ileum and the ascending colon. A monobloc oncological resection was performed, followed by the restoration of digestive continuity. Anatomopathological analysis delineated a locally advanced Stromal Tumor with a high risk of recurrence. The patient underwent a course of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for 3 years, with no reported recurrence during the subsequent 3-year follow-up. Discussion: Locally advanced jejunal stromal tumors are rare. Most patients present with unspecific symptoms. Diagnosis remains challenging due to their intricate anatomical location. Decisions regarding management must be deliberated within a multidisciplinary framework, tailored to each patient's unique characteristics. While combined therapeutic modalities have demonstrated efficacy in recent studies, prudence is advised given the heightened incidence of both short and long-term complications. Conclusion: In the absence of randomized controlled trials, the management of locally advanced jejunal stromal tumors underscores the imperative of multidisciplinary collaboration in treatment deliberations. A wide, sometimes mutilating excision is only permissible if it is complete.
