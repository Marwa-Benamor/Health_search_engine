Therefore, it is mandatory to be equipped with the proper knowledge regarding the causes, signs, symptoms, and diets containing iron, which can be a good initiative for the proper treatment and management of the health hazards; also, it will help primary care physicians to differentiate the degree of the disease and further treatment, planning, and management. The recent study was performed to understand the level of knowledge and awareness about IDA and its causes, prevention, and treatment. Methods: The study was carried out through an online survey using Google forms, which were distributed to the population residing in Riyadh Province. Results and discussion: The responses received about the knowledge regarding IDA and its symptoms indicated weakness [565 (52.9%)], cold hands and feet [593 (55.5%)], and hair loss [663 (62.1)], and the majority (84.3%) of the participants believed that the major cause for IDA is malnutrition. Conclusion and recommendations: Conclusively, it was believed that the presented study will be helpful to primary care physicians, the patients suffering from IDA, and the general population with a better understanding of the causes, additional signs and symptoms, proper treatment, timely management, sources of iron, and how to avoid the worse outcomes and complications of the disease.
