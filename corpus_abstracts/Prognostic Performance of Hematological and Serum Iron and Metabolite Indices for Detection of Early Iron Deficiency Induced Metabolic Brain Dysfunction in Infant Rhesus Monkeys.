Background: The current pediatric practice of monitoring for infantile iron deficiency (ID) via hemoglobin (Hgb) screening at one year of age does not identify preanemic ID, nor protect against later neurocognitive deficits. Objectives: To identify biomarkers of iron-related metabolic alterations in the serum and brain and determine the sensitivity of conventional iron and heme indices for predicting risk of brain metabolic dysfunction using a nonhuman primate model of infantile ID. Methods: Simultaneous serum iron and RBC indices, and serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolomic profiles were determined in 20 rhesus infants, comparing iron sufficient (IS; N = 10) and ID (N = 10) infants at 2 and 4 months of age. Results: Reticulocyte hemoglobin (RET-He) was lower at 2 weeks in the ID group. Significant IS vs. ID differences in serum iron indices were present at 2 months, but Hgb and RBC indices differed only at 4 months (P < 0.05). Serum and CSF metabolomic profiles of the ID and IS groups differed at 2 and 4 months (P < 0.05). Key metabolites, including homostachydrine and stachydrine (4-5-fold lower at 4 months in ID group, P < 0.05), were altered in both serum and CSF. Iron indices and RET-He at 2 months, but not Hgb or other RBC indices, were correlated with altered CSF metabolic profile at 4 months and had comparable predictive accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve scores, 0.75-0.80). Conclusions: Preanemic ID at 2 months was associated with metabolic alterations in serum and CSF in infant monkeys. Among the RBC indices, only RET-He predicted the future risk of abnormal CSF metabolic profile with a predictive accuracy comparable to serum iron indices. The concordance of homostachydrine and stachydrine changes in serum and CSF indicates their potential use as early biomarkers of brain metabolic dysfunction in infantile ID.
