Gastrosplenic fistula (GSF) is an unusual event that might occur in patients with various gastric or splenic diseases. While GSF related to gastric and splenic malignancies is well-documented in the literature, cases of GSF due to a splenic abscess are extremely rare. We experienced the case of a 49-year-old man with a medical history of tricuspid cardiac valve replacement for infective endocarditis who presented with a sudden onset of anemia and melena. With the assistance of imaging and endoscopy, a primary splenic abscess complicated by spontaneous GSF was diagnosed. A prompt splenectomy with partial gastrectomy was performed. GSF is a serious occurrence associated with a high risk of morbidity and mortality. The early recognition of GSF related to a splenic abscess is crucial to prevent major complications. Surgical resection with splenectomy and partial gastrectomy is frequently preferred for the treatment of large abscesses with GSF.
