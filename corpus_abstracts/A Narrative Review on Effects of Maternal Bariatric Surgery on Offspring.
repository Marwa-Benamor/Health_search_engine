Bariatric surgery (BS) has emerged as an efficient approach for addressing obesity, offering long-term benefits encompassing substantial weight loss and improving metabolic disorders. Many women of childbearing age opt for BS to enhance their health and well-being. The weight loss achieved through these procedures can positively impact pregnancy outcomes, but it's crucial to consider potential drawbacks. Micronutrient deficiencies, such as anemia resulting from iron or vitamin B12 deficiency, are a legitimate concern. Making the decision to have a BS is a complex process with many possible obstacles. The complicated nature of this decision is highlighted by worries about dumping syndrome, surgical complications that could include the risk of internal hernias, and the possibility that infants could be labeled as small for gestational age because of maternal undernourishment. Furthermore, there is a notable absence of international consensus regarding the ideal timing for conceiving after undergoing BS. Therefore, this narrative review extensively explores the existing body of literature, offering insights into the prevailing challenges encountered before and during pregnancy following BS. These challenges encompass a wide range of considerations, commencing with fertility-related issues. The study will cover strategies for addressing vitamin and nutritional deficiencies through supplementation, subtleties of post-BS altered glucose metabolism and how it affects the detection and treatment of gestational diabetes, how dumping syndrome progresses, various surgical problems, and how different bariatric procedures affect pregnancy and fetal outcomes. These include a tendency to give birth to children considered undersized for gestational age, nutritional deficits, anemia, and abnormal maternal glucose metabolism. This review offers a comprehensive exploration of the multifaceted landscape of pregnancy in the context of BS. It aims to provide a valuable resource for healthcare professionals and women considering pregnancy after undergoing BS, enabling them to make well-informed decisions and receive appropriate care during this critical phase of life.
