Objective: This review aims to identify the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions in preventing iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women with a normal course of pregnancy. Introduction: The global prevalence of anemia among pregnant women is 36.5%, posing risks to women and fetuses. This underscores the need for effective prevention; however, the effectiveness of non-pharmacological approaches in preventing pregnancy anemia remains unclear. Inclusion criteria: This review will encompass experimental and quasi-experimental studies on the following approaches to prevent anemia during pregnancy: recommendations for dietary supplements, oral iron supplements (over the counter), provision of supplements to promote iron absorption, participation in anemia prevention education, and provision of information. There will be no restrictions on the duration or frequency of intervention, and longitudinal intervention studies will be included. In studies with a control group, the comparator may be usual care or pharmacological interventions; in studies without, it may involve no intervention, temporal comparisons, or baseline periods without non-pharmacological interventions. Evaluation of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and ferritin will be included as primary outcomes. Low birth weight, preterm birth, amount of blood loss at delivery, small for gestational age, and Apgar scores will be included as secondary outcomes. Methods: A search will be conducted of MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Scopus, Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ICHUSHI-Web. Researchers will screen studies, extract data, assess the quality of studies, and analyze the data in accordance with the JBI guidance for systematic reviews of effectiveness. GRADE will be used to assess the certainty of the findings. Review registration number: PROSPERO CRD42022344155.
