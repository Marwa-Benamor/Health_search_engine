Purpose: To examine the feasibility of using MEMS® bottles to assess adherence among adolescents and emerging adults with sickle cell disease. Patients and methods: Eighteen non-Hispanic Black participants with HbSS (M = 17.8 years; 61% male) were given a MEMS® bottle to store hydroxyurea (n = 14) or deferasirox (n = 4). Results: One hundred percent initiated MEMS® use and 61% sustained use through the 18-week study; at follow-up, only 11% returned their bottle on time. Barriers to MEMS® use included medication changes and transition to adult care; facilitators included tip sheets and reminders. Conclusion: While MEMS® is acceptable to this population, ensuring sustained use and timely provision of bottles will require additional supports.
