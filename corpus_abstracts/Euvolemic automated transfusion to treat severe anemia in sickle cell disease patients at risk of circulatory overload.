Background: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion remains a major treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients with SCD have a high prevalence of renal impairment and cardiorespiratory disease, conferring risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO). Study design and methods: We describe an approach, titled euvolemic automated transfusion (EAT), to transfuse SCD patients with severe anemia who are at risk of TACO. In EAT, plasmapheresis is performed using donor RBCs, rather than albumin or plasma, as replacement fluid. Euvolemia is maintained. A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients with SCD who underwent EAT at our institution over a 10-year period, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EAT. Results: Eleven SCD patients underwent 109 EAT procedures (1-59 procedures per patient). The median age was 42 years (IQR = [30-49]) and 82% (n = 9) were female. Most (82%; n = 9) patients had severe chronic kidney disease and 55% (n = 6) had heart failure. One (9%) patient had a history of life-threatening TACO. Mean pre- and post-procedure Hct values were 19.8% (SD ± 1.6%) and 29.1% (SD ± 1.4%), respectively. The average Hct increment was 3.2% per RBC unit. Only two EAT-related complications were recorded during the 109 procedures: central line-associated infection and citrate toxicity (muscle cramping). EAT used an average of two RBC units less than that projected for standard automated RBC exchange. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that EAT is safe and effective to treat patients with SCD and severe anemia, who are at risk for TACO. EAT requires fewer RBC units compared to automated RBC exchange.
