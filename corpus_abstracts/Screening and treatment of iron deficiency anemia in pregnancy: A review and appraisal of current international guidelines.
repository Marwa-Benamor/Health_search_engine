Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in pregnancy is a common diagnosis that is associated with adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes. There remains uncertainty regarding how best to screen for, prevent, and treat established IDA in pregnancy. There is no consensus on the benefits of routine iron supplementation in pregnancy, with concerns regarding potential harmful effects of routine iron supplementation in women who are iron replete. Fourteen international guidelines were selected and appraised and compared by a multidisciplinary team. The AGREE II GRS tool was used. Each reviewer independently made their own assessment, and the scores from 1 to 7 were also collated and averaged for an overall score incorporating seven domains: process of development, clarity of presentation, completeness of reporting, clinical validity, and overall quality. The reviewers' scores were also individually compared according to discipline. The mean score across all the guidelines was 4.4 (range 3.5-6.5). Only half of the guidelines recommend routine iron in pregnancy. In terms of screening recommendations, five guidelines recommend screening with ferritin in addition to a full blood count in pregnancy, two recommend selective screening with ferritin for at risk groups only, and one guideline suggests using ferritin where feasible. Although many of the guidelines recommend similar doses of oral elemental iron of 100-200 mg daily for the treatment of established IDA in pregnancy, two recommend twice or three times daily dosing. Only five guidelines give hemoglobin rises to expect within specific timeframes. There remains a need to clarify the optimal screening method, dosing regimen, timing, and route of iron supplementation in pregnancy. Robust randomized controlled data are needed to guide appropriate prevention and management.
