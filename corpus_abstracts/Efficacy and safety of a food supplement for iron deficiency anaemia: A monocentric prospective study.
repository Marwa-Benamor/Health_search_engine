Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is the most prevalent worldwide nutrient deficiency-related disease. The 30% of IDA female patients is represented by non-pregnant women and the 42% are pregnant women. Oral iron supplementation represents the first-line treatment for IDA. Iron sulphate is the main source of iron, but despite its effectiveness, its use correlates with a high incidence of side effects. Consequently, finding new iron sources became challenging. An innovative microencapsulated and micronized iron saccharate, empowered with vitamins (B6, B12, B9 and C), has been evaluated for the efficacy and safety in a monocentric prospective observational study. 80 female subjects diagnosed for IDA received one dose/daily of the food supplement for an observation period of 60 days (T60) and 120 days (T120). To measure IDA-related biochemical parameters, full blood tests have been collected at each time. To evaluate Quality-of-Life (QoL) the Short-form 12 Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary (SF-12 PCS and MCS) together with sign and symptoms collection have been used to follow improvements in IDA-related indicators. Finally, side effects have been registered along the observation period. Obtained data revealed that the food supplement was effective and well tolerated. Changes in haemoglobin levels and other iron metabolism values have been observed, confirming the effectiveness of the tested product, from the biochemical point of view. In parallel, QoL improvement and signs and symptoms reduction confirm the high bioavailability and tolerability of this innovative iron source.
