Background: There is scarce evidence on the effectiveness and safety of recommended-dose direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in obese patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). Material and methods: We used the data in the RIETE registry to compare the rates of VTE recurrences and major bleeding during long-term therapy with DOACs at recommended doses in patients with body mass index â‰¥30 kg/m2 (obese) vs. those with BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2 (normal weight). We performed regression models with competing risks for death. Results: From January 2013 through October 2022, 2885 obese patients and 2676 with normal weight in RIETE received rivaroxaban (n = 3020), apixaban (n = 1754), edoxaban (n = 636) or dabigatran (n = 151). Median age was 63 years and 52 % were female. At baseline, obese patients were more likely to have diabetes (18.6 % vs. 8.4 %), hypertension (51.9 % vs. 31.4 %) or pulmonary embolism (67.7 % vs. 61 %), and less likely to have renal insufficiency (5.3 % vs. 16 %) or anaemia (21.8 % vs. 28 %%). During anticoagulation (median, 147 vs. 101 days), the obese had a similar rate of VTE recurrences (1.71 vs. 2.14 events per 100 patients-years; hazard ratio (HR): 0.81; 95 % CI: 0.49-1.34) or major bleeding (1.45 vs. 1.76 per 100 patients-years; HR: 0.91; 95 % CI: 0.52-1.59) than those with normal weight. These findings persisted after multivariable analysis (recurrent VTE, HR: 0.80; 95 % CI: 0.48-1.32; major bleeding, HR: 1.11; 95 % CI: 0.60-2.07). Conclusion: The use of DOACs at recommended doses in obese patients with VTE was associated with similar rates of VTE recurrences or major bleeding than in patients with normal weight.
