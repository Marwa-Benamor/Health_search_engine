Canine Pyometra, also known as cystic endometrial hyperplasia complex, is a common reproductive issue in bitches. This study aimed to identify associated risk factors, hematological variation, bacteria involved, and the most potent anti-bacterial against bacterial isolates of canine pyometra. Forty-five bitches of different habitats, breeds, and ages infected with pyometra were included in the study. The samples were cultured to isolate bacteria associated with the pyometra and antibiotic sensitivity was done for each bacterial isolates to get antibiogram. The study findings showed that potential risk factors such as age group, medroxyprogesterone acetate administration, and changes in the white blood cells parameters were significantly associated (P < 0.05) with the type of pyometra. Closed cervix pyometra in dogs showed significantly higher prevalence of clinical signs including depression, vomiting, abdominal enlargement, and fever compared to the open cervix pyometra. Low levels of red blood cells, pack cell volume, and hemoglobin indicated that the pyometra-infected dogs were more likely to have normocytic, normochromic, and non-regenerative anemia. Pyometra was attributed to an increase in AST (Aspertate aminotransferase), ALT (Alanine transaminase), ALP (Alkaline phosphatase), BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen), and Creatinine while a decrease in serum albumin. Of the all bacterial isolates, E. coli (35.55%) was the most common pathogen isolated from canine pyometra, followed by Pseudomonas spp. (26.66%). E coli and Pseudomonas spp. were susceptible to Imipenem, Amikacin, and Gentamicin while highly resistant to Ampicillin and Erythromycin. Imipenem, Amikacin, and Gentamicin were the most sensitive antibiotics, while Ampicillin and Erythromycin were the most resistant antibiotics for the bacterial strain isolated from canine pyometra. Multidrug resistant was observed in 26 of the isolated bacteria, indicating acquired resistance due to improper and uncontrolled use. Hence early diagnosis and close monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility before therapeutic intervention is indispensable in preventing the global threat of antimicrobial resistance.
