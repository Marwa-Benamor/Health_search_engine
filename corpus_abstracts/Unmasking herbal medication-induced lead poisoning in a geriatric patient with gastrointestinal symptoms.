Lead poisoning, often associated with occupational exposure, can also arise from intake of traditional and herbal medicines with high lead content. Geriatric patients displaying gastrointestinal symptoms from such sources are frequently misdiagnosed. An individual in his 70s reported to our geriatric clinic with vomiting, constipation and anaemia. A meticulous history unveiled his recent intake of herbal remedies. Heavy metal assay indicated elevated lead levels in his blood and urine, consistent with the high lead content we measured in the herbal medication. Following supportive treatment, nutritional supplementation and chelation therapy with calcium disodium EDTA, he improved. Follow-up tests indicated a decrease in lead levels and resolution of anaemia. This case emphasises the importance of considering lead poisoning as a potential diagnosis in patients with unexplained symptoms, particularly when there is a history of herbal or alternative medication intake. Timely recognition and appropriate management can lead to better outcome.
