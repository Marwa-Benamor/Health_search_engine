Background: Increasing evidence indicate that enhanced adipogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) could contribute to the adiposity alteration in marrow microenvironment of aplastic anemia (AA). Identifying small molecule drugs with role in inhibiting adipogenesis of BM-MSCs may represent a novel direction in AA therapy by improving BM-MSCs mediated marrow microenvironment. Methods: For the purpose, we isolated AA BM-MSCs through whole bone marrow cell culture, evaluated a series of small molecule drugs using the in vitro adipogenic differentiation model of BM-MSCs, and finally focused on emodin, a natural anthraquinone derivative. Subsequently, we systematically investigated the molecular mechanism of emodin in attenuating adipogenic process by means of microarray profiling, bioinformatics analysis and lentivirus-mediated functional studies and rescue assay. Results: We found that emodin presented significantly suppressive effect on the in vitro adipogenic differentiation of AA BM-MSCs. Further mechanistic investigation revealed that emodin could increase the expression of Tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) which exhibited remarkably decreased expression in AA BM-MSCs compared with the normal counterparts and was subsequently demonstrated as a negative regulator in adipogenesis of AA BM-MSCs. Besides, TRIB3 depletion alleviated the suppressive effect of emodin on the adipogenic differentiation of AA BM-MSCs. Conclusion: Our findings propose that emodin mediated TRIB3 up-regulation alleviates the adipogenic capacity of AA BM-MSCs, and emodin could serve as a potential therapeutic regimen for AA therapy.
