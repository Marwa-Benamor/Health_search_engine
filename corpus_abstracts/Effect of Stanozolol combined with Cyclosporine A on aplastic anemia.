Objective: To investigate the clinical efficacy of Stanozolol combined with Cyclosporine A for treatment of aplastic anemia and its influence on cytokine levels. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of 90 patients with aplastic anemia treated in Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Third Hospital from July 2019 to July 2022. According to the different treatment methods, these patients were assigned into a control group and an observation group, with 45 cases in each group. Patients in the control group were treated with Stanozolol alone, while those in the observation group were treated with the combination of Stanozolol and Cyclosporine A. Patients in both groups were treated for six months continuously. The indicators in terms of therapeutic effect, drug onset time, cytokine levels, quality of life, and adverse reactions were recorded and compared between the two groups. Results: After treatment, the total response rate in the observation group was significantly higher than in the control group (91.11% vs. 71.11%, P<0.05). The drug onset time in the observation group was shorter than that in control group (42.35±3.68 vs. 68.72±5.49, P<0.05). In contrast to the control group, the observation group exhibited significantly decreased levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-2 (IL-2), and an increased level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) after treatment, with significant differences (all P<0.05). The QLQ-C30 scores in the observation group were significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.05). Moreover, there was no statistical difference in the overall incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups (11.11% vs. 17.78%). Conclusion: Stanozolol combined with Cyclosporine A is more effective than Stanozolol alone in treatment of aplastic anemia.
