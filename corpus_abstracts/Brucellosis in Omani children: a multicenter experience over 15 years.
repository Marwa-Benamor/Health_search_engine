Background: Brucellosis, a common zoonotic disease worldwide, can lead to serious complications in humans. In Oman, the disease occurs most often in the south, but is increasing in the north. Objectives: Describe brucellosis in children in the Northern Governorate in Oman. Design: Retrospective, observational. Settings: Hospitals in the Northern Governorate in Oman. Patients and methods: We collected data on the demographics, distribution, common clinical presentations, risk factors, laboratory findings, therapy, and complications of confirmed cases of brucellosis. We included all brucellosis cases up to the age of 13 years at the Child Health Department in Royal, Suhar, Al Rustaq and Nizwa Hospitals over a 15-year period. Main outcome measures: Descriptive findings of brucellosis. Sample size: 57 confirmed cases. Results: The 57 confirmed cases of Brucella had a mean age of 6 years. Most of the cases were from Dhakhiliya 21 (36.8%) and Batinah 18 (31.6%). Consumption of raw milk was documented in 75% and 41% had animal contact. From 2010, there was a marked rise of the cases with a maximum rise was noticed in 2019 with a total of 10 cases. The main clinical manifestations were fever (92%, n=52), arthritis (44%, n=25), which involved mainly knees and hips. Forty-two had bacteremia, 41% anemia, 10% osteomyelitis/septic arthritis, one case with congenital brucellosis and one case neurobrucellosis (1.8%). Forty cases had positive serology results of which 19 had positive cultures. Most cases had received cotrimoxazole and rifampin as the primary treatment regimen 22 (40%). Four patients relapsed (7%) after treatment completion. Conclusion: This study showed the distribution and clinical characteristics of brucellosis in different regions in the Northern Governorate in Oman. Although the numbers of cases remained low, the gradual increase is concerning for public health and preventive strategies. Further studies are needed to compare this data with the Southern region. Limitation: Retrospective study with small sample size.
