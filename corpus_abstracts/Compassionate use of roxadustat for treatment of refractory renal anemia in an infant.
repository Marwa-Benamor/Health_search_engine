Background: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have played an important role in the treatment of renal anemia in children, but cannot improve hemoglobin to target level in some cases. Roxadustat, a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, can stimulate endogenous erythropoietin production and regulate iron metabolism even in patients with kidney failure. However, roxadustat has not yet been approved for use in children. Case-diagnosis/treatment: We report a case of refractory renal anemia in an 80-day-old boy, who was hyporesponsive to ESAs even in combination with iron supplementation and transfusion. Compassionate use of roxadustat successfully corrected the intractable anemia. Hyperkalemia is a manageable adverse event of concern during follow-up. Conclusion: The successful experience in this case may inform the clinical utility of roxadustat for refractory renal anemia in children, which should be further confirmed by well-designed prospective clinical trials.
