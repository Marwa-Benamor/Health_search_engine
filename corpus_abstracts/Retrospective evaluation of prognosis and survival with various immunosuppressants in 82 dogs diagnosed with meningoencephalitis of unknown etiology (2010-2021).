Background: Meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown etiology (MUE) is a comprehensive term for non-infectious inflammatory brain diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by abnormal autoimmune responses. This study aims to compare the differences in survival and clinical response of MUE according to the adjuvant immunosuppressant use. Medical records of 82 dogs diagnosed with MUE were reviewed retrospectively. Results: The overall survival time was 769 days (range 14-2687 days). The median survival time for each adjunctive was: leflunomide 1035 days (range 126-2163 days), mycophenolate mofetil 865 days (range 39-2191 days), cyclosporin 441 days (range 11-2176 days), cytosine arabinoside 754 days (range 6-1898 days) and a combination of mycophenolate mofetil and cytosine arabinoside 132 days (range 23-1227 days). There was no significant difference in the incidence rate of adverse events according to the immunosuppressants, but moderate to severe anemia was confirmed in 3 patients (18.7%) in the leflunomide group. Conclusions: The survival time and response rate of MUE dogs differed depending on which adjunctive immunosuppressants were used. Leflunomide showed a long survival time and a relatively good response rate in dogs with MUE. However, a large-scale further study with standardized doses of immunosuppressants and supportive treatment and constant monitoring interval is needed.
