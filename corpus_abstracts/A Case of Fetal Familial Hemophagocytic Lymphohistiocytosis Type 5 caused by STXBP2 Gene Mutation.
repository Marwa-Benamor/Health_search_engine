Background: Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 5 (FHL-5) is a rare hyper-inflammatory syndrome caused by mutations in STXBP2. Most cases present at 2 - 6 months of age, and FHL-5 is extremely rare in neonates. Methods: Appropriate laboratory tests, abdominal ultrasonography and whole exome sequencing were carried out. Respiratory support, antibiotics, and transfusion of blood products were done. Results: Laboratory tests revealed metabolic acidosis, thrombocytopenia, mild anemia, and low fibrinogen level. Blood culture, metagenomics, and TORCH screening were negative. Liver and spleen enlargements were confirmed by abdominal ultrasonography. Whole exome sequencing identified a homozygous mutation in STXBP2 c. 1432del G (p. V478Sfs*5). The heterozygous STXBP2 mutation was identified in the paternal grandfather, maternal grandfather, and parents. Conclusions: Here we report a case with a novel homozygous deletion in exon 16 of STXBP2, which caused the earliest reported case of FHL-5 in a neonate. Our results identify a new pathogenic variant for the early identification and clinical consultation of FHL-5.
