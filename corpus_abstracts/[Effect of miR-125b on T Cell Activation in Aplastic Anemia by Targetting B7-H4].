Objective: To investigate the effect of miR-125b on T cell activation in patients with aplastic anemia (AA) and its molecular mechanism. Methods: A total of 30 AA patients were enrolled in department of hematology, Binzhou Medical University Hospital from January 2018 to October 2021, as well as 15 healthy individuals as healthy control (HC) group. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated, in which the levels of miR-125b and B7-H4 mRNA were detected by RT-qPCR. Immunomagnetic beads were used to separate naive T cells and non-naive T cells from AA patients and healthy people to detect the levels of miR-125b and B7-H4 mRNA. Lentivirus LV-NC inhibitor and LV-miR-125b inhibitor were transfected into cells, and T cell activation was detected by flow cytometry. The dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was used to detect the targetting relationship between miR-125b and B7-H4. RT-qPCR and Western blot were used to detect the levels of miR-125b, CD40L, ICOS, IL-10 mRNA and B7-H4 protein. Results: Compared with HC group, the expression of miR-125b was up-regulated but B7-H4 mRNA was down-regulated in PBMCs of AA patients (P <0.05), and the proportions of CD4+CD69+ T cells and CD8+CD69+ T cells in PBMCs of AA patients were higher (P <0.05). The expression of miR-125b was significantly up-regulated but B7-H4 mRNA was down-regulated in both naive T cells and non-naive T cells of AA patients (P <0.05), and non-naive T cells was more significant than naive T cells (P <0.05). Compared with NC inhibitor group, the expression of miR-125b was significantly decreased, the expression level of CD69 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in PBMCs was also significantly decreased, while the luciferase activity was significantly increased after co-transfection of miR-125b inhibitor and B7-H4-3'UTR-WT in the miR-125b inhibitor group (P <0.05). Compared with NC inhibitor group, the mRNA and protein levels of B7-H4 were significantly increased in the miR-125b inhibitor group (P <0.05). Compared with miR-125b inhibitor+shRNA group, the expression levels of CD69 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly increased, and the levels of CD40L, ICOS and IL-10 mRNA were also significantly increased in the miR-125b inhibitor+sh-B7-H4 group (P <0.05). Conclusion: MiR-125b may promote T cell activation by targetting B7-H4 in AA patients.
